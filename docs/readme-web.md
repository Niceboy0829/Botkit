# Botkit Web Connector

The power of bots and conversational software can included in any website or app using Botkit's new web connector!

## What is this?

This connector provides a basic interface for Botkit to send and receive messages directly, rather than relying on a third party messaging service like Slack or Facebook messenger.
It includes a built-in chat server that can send and receive messages using real-time websocket connections or asynchronous webhooks.
This allows Botkit bots to live on the web, or be embedded into websites and native mobile apps.

The functionality provided in the connector is actually very simple, and requires integration with a webserver (to serve the application and host the chat server) and a front-end client (to provide a user interface and render messages). These components are provided in a separate project, [Botkit Anywhere](https://github.com/howdyai/botkit-starter-web).

## Getting Started

Everything you need to build your bot is included in [Botkit Anywhere](https://github.com/howdyai/botkit-starter-web),
a boilerplate application that includes all the components needed to operate your bot, as well as sample code and extra features.

* All the features of Botkit Core and Botkit Studio
* A built-in chat server that can handle thousands of simultaneous conversations
* A customizable front-end chat client built with HTML, CSS, and Javascript
* A webserver for serving the application to users and hosting your bot's business logic

**Most developers should start with [the starter kit](https://github.com/howdyai/botkit-starter-web) rather than make direct use of the Botkit core library.**
