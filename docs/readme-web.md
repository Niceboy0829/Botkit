# Botkit Web Connector

## What is this?

Botkit's Web Connector includes a built-in chat server that can send and receive messages using real-time websocket connections
or asynchronous webhooks. This allows Botkit bots to live on the web, or be embedded into websites and native mobile apps.

Botkit's built-in chat server does not require any third party services to work - messages are sent and received directly by your own app!

## Getting Started

Everything you need to build your bot is included in [Botkit Anywhere](https://github.com/howdyai/botkit-starter-web),
a boilerplate project that includes all the components needed to operate your bot, as well as sample code and extra features.

* All the features of Botkit Core and Botkit Studio
* A built-in chat server that can handle thousands of simultaneous conversations
* A customizable front-end chat client built with HTML, CSS, and Javascript
* A webserver for serving the application to users and hosting your bot's business logic

*Most developers should start with the starter kit rather than make direct use of the Botkit Core library.*

### **Botkit Studio**

Botkit Studio is a dashboard and IDE designed to super-charge Botkit. It includes a web-based interface for building and managing dialog, an activity console, third party integrations, and advanced analytics tools like customer segmenting, conversion funnels, and user retention metrics.

Sign up for a free Botkit Studio account, and it will guide you through the process to create, configure and deploy your Botkit app!

### Use the Botkit Command Line Tool

Set up a boilerplate Botkit application using our command line tool. Using the commands highlighted below, install the command line tool from npm, then use it automatically create and configure a customizable app.

```
npm install -g botkit
botkit new --platform web
```

## Developing with Botkit for Web

 The full code for a simple bot is below:

 ~~~ javascript
 var Botkit = require('botkit');

 var controller = Botkit.socketbot({});

 controller.setupWebserver(process.env.PORT || 3000, function(err, webserver) {
     controller.createWebhookEndpoints(webserver, function() {
         console.log("BOTKIT: Webhooks set up!");
     });
 });

 controller.hears('hello', 'direct_message,direct_mention', function(bot, message) {
     bot.reply(message, 'Hi');
 });

 controller.on('direct_mention', function(bot, message) {
     bot.reply(message, 'You mentioned me and said, "' + message.text + '"');
 });

 controller.on('direct_message', function(bot, message) {
     bot.reply(message, 'I got your private message. You said, "' + message.text + '"');
 });
 ~~~
