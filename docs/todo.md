# To Do

These items still need to be addressed!

* bot.reply should take a string OR a message object
* bot.startDM should work like startConversation

* document token replacement (identity, responses, origin, vars)
* how to provide the default web homepage?
* How to provide customization of behavior of post-oauth / oauth error
* how to respond directly to outgoing webhook / slash command
* how to identify the team a message is from
* how to identify the bot itself

* can bot.say be made to have 1 param?
* should bot.say use incoming_webhook if no other configured?


* What functions need to be overridden to handle the multi team stuff?


* bot.say takes a convo paramter? why? huh?
