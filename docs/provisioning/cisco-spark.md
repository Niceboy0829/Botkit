# Configure Botkit and Cisco Spark

Cisco Spark is fairly easy to provision your bot, but there are a few places you can run into trouble.

### 1. [Install Botkit](https://github.com/howdyai/botkit/blob/master/docs/readme-ciscospark.md#getting-started)

### 2. Create a [New Bot](https://developer.ciscospark.com/add-bot.html) in the Cisco Developer portal.

Take note of the bot username, you'll need it later.

*Note* - Your bot will need a 512x512px image icon hosted anywhere on the web. This can be changed later.

### 3. You will receive an `access token`.
Write this down, you won't be able to see this later (but you will be able to create a new one).
### 4. [Run your bot](https://github.com/howdyai/botkit/blob/master/docs/readme-ciscospark.md#getting-started) with the provided token. 
You should now be able to search your spark team for the bot username, and add it to your team.

### 5. Customize your Bot

Using [Botkit Studio's conversation design tools](https://studio.botkit.ai) and the powerful [Botkit SDK](https://github.com/howdyai/botkit), you can build your dream bot!
