# Building with Botkit Studio

[Botkit Studio](https://studio.botkit.ai) is a hosted development tool that enhances and expands the capabilities of Botkit. While developers may use Botkit without Studio, a Studio account will substantially ease the development and deployment of a Bot, help to avoid common coding pitfalls,
a valuable management interface for the bot's dialog content and configuration. Botkit Studio is a product of [Howdy.ai](http://howdy.ai), the creators of Botkit.

This document covers the Botkit Studio SDK details only. [Start here](readme.md) if you want to learn about to develop with Botkit.

## Key Features

The goal of Botkit Studio is to make building bots with Botkit easier than ever before.
The tools and this SDK are based on feedback from dozens of Botkit developers and more than a year of building and operating our flagship bot, [Howdy](https://howdy.ai).
However, our intent is not to cover every base needed for building a successful bot. Rather, we focus on several key problem areas:

* **Script Authoring**: Botkit Studio provides a cloud-based authoring tool for creating and maintaining multi-thread conversations and scripts. Scripts managed in Studio can be changed without changing the underlying application code, allowing for content updates, feature additions and product development without code deploys. Many types of conversation will _no longer require code_ to function.

* **Trigger Management**: Developers may define trigger words and patterns externally from their code, allowing those triggers to expand and adapt as humans use the bot.

* **Easy to use SDK**: Our open source SDK provides simple mechanisms for accessing these features from within your application.  With only a few new functions: [studio.get](#controllerstudioget), [studio.run](#controllerstudiorun), and [studio.runTrigger](#controllerruntrigger), your bot has full access to all of the content managed by the cloud service. These functions can be used to build light weight integrations with Studio, or turn over complete control to the cloud brain.

The screenshot above shows the script authoring tool, where bot developers can write dialog,
manage [conversation threads](readme.md#conversation-threads), define variables to capture user input, and set triggers that will automatically activate the bot.

## Getting Started

Before you get started, it is important to note that Botkit Studio is a extra set of features
built on top of [all of the other existing Botkit features and plugins](readme.md), and all of the documentation and tutorials for those features applies to bots built with Studio as well.

If you already have a Botkit bot, you may want to start [here](#adding-studio-features-to-an-existing-bot).

The instructions below cover setting up a bot on a Slack team. However, you may also use any of the other Botkit connectors to operate a bot on [Facebook](readme-facebook.md), [Twilio](readme-twilioipm.md), or any other supported platform. Follow the instructions for configuring Botkit on those dedicated pages, then pick up below with the additional Studio configuration steps.

### Start with the Starter Kit

1) [Register for a developer account at Botkit Studio](https://studio.botkit.ai/signup)

2) Download the Botkit Studio Starter Kit at [https://github.com/howdyai/botkit-studio-starter](https://github.com/howdyai/botkit-studio-starter). This code repository contains a fully functioning bot configured to work with Botkit Studio, and code examples demonstrating all of the key features. It also contains supporting material for the [tutorial included here](#tutorial).

3) Make a bot integration inside of your Slack channel. Go here:

https://my.slack.com/services/new/bot

Enter a name for your bot.
Make it something fun and friendly, but avoid a single task specific name.
Bots can do lots! Let's not pigeonhole them.

When you click "Add Bot Integration", you are taken to a page where you can add additional details about your bot, like an avatar, as well as customize its name & description.

Copy the API token that Slack gives you. You'll need it.

4) Inside Botkit Studio, locate the "API Keys" tab for your bot account, and copy the token.  Now you've got everything you need!

4) With both tokens in hand, run the starter kit bot application from your command line:

```
token=REPLACE_THIS_WITH_YOUR_TOKEN studio_token=REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_BOTKIT_TOKEN node .
```

5) Your bot should be online! Within Slack, send it a quick direct message to say hello. It should say hello back!

6) Create new scripts, triggers and behaviors within your Botkit Studio developer account, while connecting it to the application logic present in your bot code by using the features described [in the function index](#function-index).

### Adding Studio Features to an Existing Bot

If you've already got a bot built with Botkit, you can get started with new Studio features with only a few extra lines of code.

After you've registered for a Botkit Studio developer account, you will receive an API token that grants your bot access to the content and features managed by the Studio cloud service.  You can add this to your existing Botkit app by passing in the Studio token to the Botkit constructor using the `studio_token` field:

```
// Create the Botkit controller that has access to Botkit Studio
var controller = Botkit.slackbot({
    debug: false,
    studio_token: 'MY_BOTKIT_STUDIO_TOKEN'
});
```

In order to add the Botkit Studio "catch all" handler that will activate the cloud script triggering service into your bot, add the following code to your application below all other Botkit `hears()` events. This will pass any un-handled direct message or direct mention through Botkit Studio's trigger service, and, should a matching trigger be found, execute the script.

```
controller.on('direct_message,direct_mention,mention', function(bot, message) {
    controller.studio.runTrigger(bot, message.text, message.user, message.channel).catch(function(err) {
        bot.reply(message, 'I experienced an error with a request to Botkit Studio: ' + err);
    });
});
```

## The Botkit Studio Data Flow
### Keep your bot secure and your user messages private!

How do the Botkit tools handle your messages? Where do messages come from and go to?

1. The Botkit-powered application you build (and host yourself) receives messages directly from a messaging platform such as Slack or Facebook.

2. Botkit will evaluate this message locally (within your application) to match it to internally defined triggers (using `hears()` or `on()` handlers).

3. If and only if a message matches the conditions for being analyzed remotely -- by default, only messages sent directly to the bot that are not already part of an ongoing interaction -- the message is sent over an encrypted SSL channel to the Botkit Studio trigger system.

    The trigger system (using [studio.runTrigger](#controllerstudioruntrigger)) will evaluate the input message against all configured triggers, and, should one be matched, return the full content of the script to your application.

4. Botkit will _compile_ the script received from the API into a [conversation object](readme.md#multi-message-replies-to-incoming-messages) and conduct the resulting conversation. During the course of the conversation, *no messages* are sent to the Botkit Studio APIs. Said another way, while a bot is conducting a scripted conversation, all messages are sent and received directly between the application and the messaging platform.  This projects your user's messages, reduces network traffic, and ensures that your bot will not share information unnecessarily.

Our recommended best practices for the security and performance of your bot and the privacy of your users is to send as few messages to be interpreted by the trigger APIs as possible. As described above, a normal Botkit Studio bot should _only_ send messages to the API that can reasonably be expected to contain trigger words.

The bottom line is, Botkit Studio does _not_ put itself between your users and your application. All messages are delivered _first_ and directly to your application, and only sent to our APIs once specific criteria are met. This is notably different than some other bot building services that actually receive and process messages on your behalf.

## Function Index

### controller.studio.run()
| Argument | Description
|---  |---
| bot   | A bot instance
| input_text | The name of a script defined in Botkit Studio
| user | the user id of the user having the conversation
| channel | the channel id where the conversation is occurring

`controller.studio.run()` will load a script defined in the Botkit Studio authoring tool, convert it into a Botkit conversation, and perform the conversation to it's completion.

Developers may tap into the conversation as it is conducted using the [before](#controllerstudiobefore), [after](#controllerstudioafter), and [validate](#controllerstudiovalidate) hooks. It is also possible to bind to the normal `convo.on('end')` event because this function also returns the resulting conversation object via a promise:

```
controller.studio.run(bot, 'hello', message.user, message.channel).then(function(convo) {
    convo.on('end', function(convo) {
        if (convo.status=='completed') {
            // handle successful conversation
        } else {
            // handle failed conversation
        }
    });
});
```

### controller.studio.get()
| Argument | Description
|---  |---
| bot   | A bot instance
| input_text | The name of a script defined in Botkit Studio
| user | the user id of the user having the conversation
| channel | the channel id where the conversation is occurring

`controller.studio.get()` is nearly identical to `controller.studio.run()`, except that instead of automatically and immediately starting the conversation, the function returns it in a dormant state.  

While developers may still tap into the conversation as it is conducted using the [before](#controllerstudiobefore), [after](#controllerstudioafter), and [validate](#controllerstudiovalidate) hooks, it must first be activated using `convo.activate()` in the results of the promise returned by the function.

This enables developers to add template variables to the conversation object before it sends its first message. Read about [using variables in messages](readme.md#using-variable-tokens-and-templates-in-conversation-threads)

```
controller.studio.run(bot, 'hello', message.user, message.channel).then(function(convo) {
    convo.setVar('date', new Date()); // available in message text as {{vars.date}}
    convo.setVar('news', 'This is a news item!'); // ailable as {{vars.news}}

    // crucial! call convo.activate to set it in motion
    convo.activate();
});
```


### controller.studio.runTrigger()
| Argument | Description
|---  |---
| bot   | A bot instance
| input_text | The name of a script defined in Botkit Studio
| user | the user id of the user having the conversation
| channel | the channel id where the conversation is occurring

In addition to storing the content and structure of conversation threads, developers can also use Botkit Studio to define and maintain the trigger phrases and patterns that cause the bot to take actions. `controller.studio.runTrigger()` takes _arbitrary input text_ and evaluates it against all existing triggers configured in a bot's account. If a trigger is matched, the script data is returned, compiled, and executed by the bot.

This is different than `studio.run()` and `studio.get()` in that the input text may include _additional text_ other than an the exact name of a script. In most cases, `runTrigger()` will be configured to receive all messages addressed to the bot that were not otherwise handled, allowing Botkit Studio to be catch-all. See below:

```
// set up a catch-all handler that will send all messages directed to the bot
// through Botkit Studio's trigger evaluation system
controller.on('direct_message,direct_mention,mention', function(bot, message) {
    controller.studio.runTrigger(bot, message.text, message.user, message.channel).catch(function(err) {
        bot.reply(message, 'I experienced an error with a request to Botkit Studio: ' + err);
    });
});
```

In order to customize the behavior of scripts triggered using `runTrigger()`, developers define `before`, `after` and `validate` hooks for each script. See docs for these functions below.

Another potential scenario for using `runTrigger()` would be to trigger a script that includes additional parameters that would normally be provided by a user, but are being provided instead by the bot. For example, it is sometimes useful to trigger another script to start when another script has ended.

```
controller.hears(['checkin'], 'direct_message', function(bot, message) {

    // when a user says checkin, we're going to pass in a more complex command to be evaluated

    // send off a string to be evaluated for triggers
    // assuming a trigger is setup to respond to `run`, this will work!
    controller.studio.runTrigger(bot, 'run checkin with ' + message.user, message.user, message.channel);
});
```

#### A note about handling parameters to a trigger

While Botkit does not currently provide any built-in mechanisms for extracting entities or parameters from the input text, that input text remains available in the `before` and `after` hooks, and can be used by developers to process this information.

The original user input text is available in the field `convo.source_message.text`. An example of its use can be see in the [Botkit Studio Starter bot](https://github.com/howdyai/botkit-studio-starter), which extracts a parameter from the help command.

```
controller.studio.before('help', function(convo, next) {

    // is there a parameter on the help command?
    // if so, change topic.
    if (matches = convo.source_message.text.match(/^help (.*)/i)) {
        if (convo.hasThread(matches[1])) {
            convo.gotoThread(matches[1]);
        }
    }

    next();

});
```

### controller.studio.before()
| Argument | Description
|---  |---
| script_name   | The name of a script defined in Botkit Studio
| hook_function | A function that accepts (convo, next) as parameters

Define `before` hooks to add data or modify the behavior of a Botkit Studio script _before_ it is activated. Multiple before hooks can be defined for any script - they will be executed in the order they are defined.

Note: hook functions _must_ call next() before ending, or the script will stop executing and the bot will be confused!

```
// Before the "tacos" script runs, set some extra template tokens like "special" and "extras"
controller.studio.before('tacos', function(convo, next) {

    convo.setVar('special', 'Taco Boats');
    convo.setVar('extras', [{'name': 'Cheese'}, {'name': 'Lettuce'}]);

    next();

});
```


### controller.studio.after()
| Argument | Description
|---  |---
| script_name   | The name of a script defined in Botkit Studio
| hook_function | A function that accepts (convo, next) as parameters

Define `after` hooks capture the results, or take action _after_ a Botkit Studio script has finished executing. Multiple after hooks can be defined for any script - they will be executed in the order they are defined.

Note: hook functions _must_ call next() before ending, or the script will stop executing and the bot will be confused!

```
// After the "tacos" command is finished, collect the order data
controller.studio.after('tacos', function(convo, next) {
    if (convo.status == 'completed') {
        var responses = convo.extractResponses();
        // store in a database
    }
    next();
});
```


### controller.studio.validate()
| Argument | Description
|---  |---
| script_name   | The name of a script defined in Botkit Studio
| variable_name | The name of a variable defined in Botkit Studio
| hook_function | A function that accepts (convo, next) as parameters

`validate` hooks are called whenever a Botkit Studio script sets or changes the value of a variable that has been defined as part of the script.

Note: hook functions _must_ call next() before ending, or the script will stop executing and the bot will be confused!

```
// Validate a "sauce" variable in the "taco" script
// this will run whenever the sauce variable is set and can be used to
// alter the course of the conversation
controller.studio.validate('tacos', 'sauce', function(convo, next) {

    var sauce = convo.extractResponse('sauce');
    sauce = sauce.toLowerCase();

    if (sauce == 'red' || sauce == 'green' || sauce == 'cheese') {
        convo.setVar('valid_sauce', true);
        next();
    } else {
        convo.gotoThread('wrong_sauce');
        next();
    }

});
```

## Tutorial
### Build a order submission bot

First go to https://api.slack.com/bot-users and follow the prompts for 'new bot user integration'.
When you are done you should have a bot that you can give a name and it should provide you with an API Token.
That API Token is your Slack Token

Download the Botkit Studio Starter Kit at: https://github.com/howdyai/botkit-studio-starter
Register for access to Botkit Studio at: https://studio.botkit.ai/signup
Confirm your access via email.
Select or create a bot you wish to modify, you get one by default.
Click the 'API' link on the left.
Copy the contents in the field to the right of 'Use this with Botkit!'.
Open a Terminal and paste the contents of that field into it.
Replace '_MY SLACK TOKEN_'  with the API Token you got from Slack.

it should look something like this:
```
studio_token=fcfItRK5RtbGzBpnEVO8ygEwse2sOFBmkdkQTAEASNeoYDXQ5heP8pmkHERptvaz token=xoxb-53054538583-GO2vZLYk8qDKmuo8pMzuztKz node .
```
Execute the Terminal command line.

You should recieve some feedback that looks like this
```
info: ** Using simple storage. Saving data to ./db
info: ** Setting up custom handlers for processing Slack messages
info: ** API CALL: https://slack.com/api/rtm.start
notice: ** BOT ID: notstatsbot ...attempting to connect to RTM!
notice: RTM websocket opened
```
If so you have successfully launched your Slack bot. In Slack send it a direct message saying 'hi'. It should respond with 'Hello! This is my hello script. You can edit it to customize my behaviors.'

## Customizing Scripts
___
Go to https://studio.botkit.ai and log in.
Click the appropriate bot.
- On the left under 'Commands' click 'hello'.
- On the right where it says 'Hello! This is my hello script. You can edit it to customize my behaviors.' Click there. Edit the text and click 'Save'.
- Now send your bot a direct message saying 'hi'.
- It should respond with the text you changed that script to

## Developing with Botkit Studio
Now that you have your development environment setup, you can begin with the task of developing your bot.

Soupme is a simple bot that can
- Read an external list of menu items
- Ask the participant to select from a list of dynamic options
- Confirm their choice and provide instructions on how to receive their item.

___
### Using the Before Middleware

The thread begins with a command to your bot: @soupme soup. Using Before Middleware we can fetch the data that will be presented to your user from an external resource. For example, if we want to display a list of soup options, along with a dynamic soup of the day option.
* Step 1: Create the 'soup' command in Botkit Studio
* Step 2: write the code in your bot that wraps it. You can use the example:
```
controller.studio.before('soup', function(convo, next){
  // get soup of the day
  var daily_special = getDailySpecial();
  convo.setVar('daily_special', daily_special);
  // get soup options
  var soup_menu = getMenu();
  convo.setVar('soup_menu', soup_menu);
  // cleanse the pallet
  convo.setVar('soup_selection', null);
  convo.setVar('selected_soup_size', null);
  next();
});
```
Assuming we have functions called getDailySpecial, and getMenu, that return some JSON formated menu items we can use ```convo.setVar()``` to set it as a variable available to the command.
The templating engine uses [mustache](https://mustache.github.io/) and any variables set are accessible in the script editor via vars. For instance those two variables would now be accessible in the script editor as ```{{vars.daily_special}}``` and ```{{vars.soup_menu}}``` You can display them using this code in your script.
* Step 3: Edit the 'soup' command in the Botkit Studio Script Editor.The user will be presented with a list of options for the soup of their choice. Add a variable called 'selected_soup' using the right collapsible menu. While we are here we should also make a 'soup_size' variable. At the end of the last question set the response to 'selected_soup'. While we are here go ahead and make a branch for when the soup is selected called 'soup_selected'. and lets make an error states while we are at it, 'invalid_soup'
we should have a screen-shot here of what the mustache template looks like in the editor.
* Step 4: Test it by direct messaging 'soup' at soupme. It should return menu of possible soups. this should also have a screen-shot.

### Using the Validate Middleware
Now that a user has been presented with a menu we want to validate their response to the question 'What would you like to order?'.
We also want to validate it against the menu, and if we find one store it for later in the conversation. Also we want to handle any human input errors here by guiding them to hopefully helpful error states. We do this with code that looks something like this:
```
controller.studio.validate('soup','selected_soup', function(convo, next) {
  var found_soup = [], possible_matches = [], soup_selection, input = convo.extractResponse('selected_soup');
  possible_matches.push(convo.vars.daily_special.name);
  convo.vars.soup_menu.forEach(function(m){
    possible_matches.push(m.name);
  });
  possible_matches.forEach(function(pm){
    var re = new RegExp('^' + input.toLowerCase() + '\\b' , 'igm');
    var found = pm.match(re);
    if(found){
      found_soup = convo.vars.soup_menu.filter(function(s){
        return s.name.toLowerCase() === pm.toLowerCase();
      });
      if(found_soup.length === 0){
        console.log(convo.vars.daily_special.name.toLowerCase(), '|', pm.toLowerCase());
        if(convo.vars.daily_special.name.toLowerCase() === pm.toLowerCase()){
          found_soup = [];
          found_soup.push(convo.vars.daily_special);
        }
      }
    }
  });
  if(found_soup.length > 0) {
    convo.setVar('soup_selection', found_soup[0]);
    convo.changeTopic('soup_selected');
  }else {
    convo.changeTopic('invalid_soup');
  }
  next();
});
```
And present a list of sub-options to determine size. There is a second validator for the second variable we need to collect. It looks something like this:
```
controller.studio.validate('soup','soup_size', function(convo, next) {
  var selected_soup_size, valid_sizes = ['small', 'medium', 'epic'], input = convo.extractResponse('soup_size');
  console.log('soup_size: ', input);
  var filtered_input = valid_sizes.filter(function(s){
    return s.toLowerCase() === input.toLowerCase();
  });
  if(filtered_input.length === 0){
    convo.changeTopic('invalid_size');
  }else if (filtered_input.length > 1) {
    convo.changeTopic('ambiguous_size');
  }else {
    selected_soup_size = filtered_input[0];
    convo.setVar('selected_soup_size', selected_soup_size);
    convo.setVar('order_confirmation', '123');
    convo.changeTopic('soup_order_complete');
  }
  next();
});
```

### Using the After Middleware
Then we can confirm with the user that the script has their correct order, and provide instructions on how to retrieve their physical order, using following code:
```
controller.studio.after('soup', function(convo, next) {
  if (convo.status == 'completed' && convo.vars.soup_selection && convo.vars.selected_soup_size) {
    console.log('--------------------------- soup order finished ----------------------------------');
    console.log('Generated a soup order for', convo.context.user, ' who ordered a', convo.vars.selected_soup_size, ' sized ', convo.vars.soup_selection.name, ' with a confirmation number of ', convo.vars.order_confirmation);
    console.log('Get started with the soup!');
    next();
  }else {
    next();
  }

});
```
This will also leave an order in the terminal. That could be piped to a database or API somewhere if you wanted to build a real one.
