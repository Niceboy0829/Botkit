# Botkit Next Major Release

This branch is home to the next major release of Botkit, which is based on a complete rewrite of the library.

This is a not a finished product! We are publishing it now as a preview so our community of 
developers, users and contributors can get involved. Some features are missing or not working,
and some features currently included may be removed.

* Keep as much of the feature set, syntax and special sauce developers know and love
* Solve persistent and hard to solve problems in previous versions of Botkit
* Use modern Javascript language features like async/await instead of callbacks
* Typescript!
* Break platform adapters (and their large dependency trees) into optional packages
* Reorganize some related projects into a monorepo
* Inheret much goodness from [Bot Builder](https://github.com/microsoft/botbuilder-js)
