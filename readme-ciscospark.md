# Botkit and Cisco Spark

Botkit is designed to ease the process of designing and running useful, creative bots that live inside Cisco Spark.

Botkit features a comprehensive set of tools
to deal with [Cisco's Spark platform](https://developer.ciscospark.com/), and allows
developers to build interactive bots and applications that send and receive messages just like real humans.

This document covers the Cisco Spark-specific implementation details only. [Start here](readme.md) if you want to learn about to develop with Botkit.

## Getting Started

1) Install Botkit [more info here](readme.md#installation)

2) [Create a bot in the Spark for Developers site](https://developer.ciscospark.com/add-bot.html). You'll receive an `access token`.

Copy this token, you'll need it!

3) If you are _not_ running your bot at a public, SSL-enabled internet address, use a tool like [ngrok](http://ngrok.io) or [localtunnel](http://localtunnel.me) to create a secure route to your development application.

```
ngrok http 3000
```

4) Run your bot application using the access token you received, the base url of your bot application, and a secret which is used to validate the origin of incoming webhooks:

```
access_token=<MY ACCESS TOKEN> public_address=<https://my_bot_url> secret=<my_secret_phrase> node spark_bot.js
```

5) Your bot should now come online and respond to requests! Find it in Cisco Spark by searching for it's name.

## Working with Cisco Spark

Botkit receives messages from Cisco Spark using webhooks, and sends messages using their APIs. This means that your bot application must present a web server that is publicly addressable. Everything you need to get started is already included in Botkit.

To connect your bot to Cisco Spark, [get an access token here](https://developer.ciscospark.com/add-bot.html). In addition to the access token,
Cisco Spark bots require a user-defined `secret` which is used to validate incoming webhooks, as well as a `public_address` which is the URL at which the bot application can be accessed via the internet.

The full code for a simple Cisco Spark bot is below:

```
var Botkit = require('./lib/Botkit.js');

var controller = Botkit.sparkbot({
    debug: true,
    log: true,
    public_address: process.env.public_address,
    ciscospark_access_token: process.env.access_token,
    secret: process.env.secret
});


var bot = controller.spawn({
});

controller.setupWebserver(process.env.PORT || 3000, function(err, webserver) {
    controller.createWebhookEndpoints(webserver, bot, function() {
        console.log("SPARK: Webhooks set up!");
    });
});


controller.on('direct_mention', function(bot, message) {
    bot.reply(message, 'You mentioned me and said, "' + message.text + '"');
});

controller.on('direct_message', function(bot, message) {
    bot.reply(message, 'I got your private message. You said, "' + message.text + '"');

});
```

## Controller Options

When creating the Botkit controller, there are several platform-specific options available.

### Botkit.sparkbot
| Argument | Description
|--- |---
| public_address | _required_ the root url of your application (https://mybot.com)
| ciscospark_access_token | _required_ token provided by Cisco Spark for your bot
| secret | _required_ secret for validating webhooks originate from Cisco Spark
| webhook_name | _optional_ name for webhook configuration on Cisco Spark side. Providing a name here allows for multiple bot instances to receive the same messages. Defaults to 'Botkit Firehose'
| limit_to_org | _optional_ organization id in which the bot should exist. If user from outside org sends message, it is ignored
| limit_to_domain | _optional_ email domain (@howdy.ai) or array of domains [@howdy.ai, @botkit.ai] from which messages can be received

```
var controller = Botkit.sparkbot({
    debug: true,
    log: true,
    public_address: 'https://mybot.ngrok.io',
    ciscospark_access_token: process.env.access_token,
    secret: 'randomstringofnumbersandcharacters12345',
    webhook_name: 'dev',
    limit_to_org: 'my_spark_org_id',
    limit_to_domain: ['@howdy.ai','@cisco.com'],
});
```


## Spark Specific Events

Once connected to Cisco Spark, your bot will receive a constant stream of events.

| Event | Description
|--- |---
| direct_message | Bot has received a message as a DM
| direct_mention | Bot has been mentioned in a public room
| self_message | Bot has received a message it sent
| user_room_join | a user has joined a room in which the bot is present
| bot_room_join | the bot has joined a new room
| user_room_leave | a user has left a room in which the bot is present
| bot_room_leave | the bot has left a room
