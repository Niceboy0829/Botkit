 * Can we refactor controller to be a big master plan that runs itself? then you can do controller.hears OR controller.addPlan(new plan())!
    -> if we do this, it will be very difficult for outside developers to build against it until planning is published (otherwise they have to build botbuilder from source from a special branch)
